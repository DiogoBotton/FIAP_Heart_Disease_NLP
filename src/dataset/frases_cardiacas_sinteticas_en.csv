"About a week ago, I started feeling chest discomfort that felt like a crushing pressure. It started after a heavy morning jog, but soon became persistent. The pain would radiate to my back and neck, making it difficult to sit upright without straining. I had no idea what was happening until I tried to walk short distances, which only made the pain worse. My heart rate increased significantly, and I found myself sweating profusely. The fatigue from this constant pain has affected my work as well; I can't concentrate on tasks that require mental effort anymore. Despite my best efforts to manage it, the symptoms have persisted for several months now. I've been advised to see a cardiologist immediately due to the severity of my condition. My risk level is low, but I am taking action now to address this health concern.",Heart Disease,Low
